This admin dashboard is designed to efficiently manage users, roles, and permissions in a secure and user-friendly interface. It allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users and roles, assign roles to users, and manage user statuses (Active/Inactive). The dashboard also provides an intuitive way to assign and modify permissions for each role. The functionality is powered by dynamic JavaScript, ensuring real-time updates, and includes modal forms for adding or editing user and role information. This solution is scalable and can be extended with real API integrations for production environments.
